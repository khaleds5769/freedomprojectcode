## TealViewController

import UIKit

class TealViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        title = "Home"

        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }
    
    
    
    
## PinkViewController


import UIKit

class PinkViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        title = "Applications"

        
        
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }
    

  

}

My project doesn't consist of lots of code as my project is done using Swift Storyboard. Below is a screenshot of the main file I worked on. I created ViewControllers and connected them with each other.
